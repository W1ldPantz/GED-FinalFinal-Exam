# GED-FinalFinal-Exam
 

What was done?

A Tetris scenario was being created which included a background, bottom piece to hold the blocks when they fall, a spawner above the actual background, which the player does not see, and a couple of blocks that will fall randomly. 


How was it done?

First the basics were created, which included the background, spawner and all of the blocks that could fall down (Tetrominoes). For the coding part of the exam, examples that were shown in the tutorials were used to help guide me in the right direction. 


Why was it done the way it was?

I don't know how to code, if I didn't use anything I wouldn't have been able to get anything done.
